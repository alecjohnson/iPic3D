To install and run iPic3D, you need to do the following:

  # make sure that you have installed:
  MPI
  HDF5

  # get the code:
  git clone https://github.com/alecjohnson/iPic3D.git
  git clone git@github.com:alecjohnson/iPic3D.git ipic3d

  # set the following bootstrapping environment variable:
  export IPIC_HOME="$HOME/ipic3d"

  # if running on a system for which ipic3d/env/<system_name>
  # exists, you just need to load the appropriate module, e.g.:
  module use $IPIC_HOME/env/judge
  module load ipic

  # otherwise (e.g. if running on your own laptop) you need to
  # define the remaining environment variables by hand (or create
  # your own module file), e.g.:
  #
  export HDF5_ROOT="/usr/local/hdf5-par"
  export IPIC_MPIRUN="mpiexec"
  # give access to the ipic script
  export PATH=$IPIC_HOME/scripts:$PATH

  # then create a build directory
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ipic cmake
  # run this again any time you change the source code
  make

  # run the code:
  ipic run

  # get help
  ipic help
